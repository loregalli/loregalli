# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am an **Informatics student** at the University of Pisa, currently on exchange at the University of Italian Switzerland (USI).

As a **Track and Field athlete**, athletics official, and sports photographer, I combine my passion for sports with technology to enhance athlete performance and experience.

I'm passionate about creating sports-focused digital content, including photography, videography, drone piloting, and graphic design,
while also providing digital solutions such as showcase websites, e-commerce, and mobile apps to improve clubs and athletes experience.

My mission is to improve the experience for athletes and sports clubs through technology and creativity.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!
